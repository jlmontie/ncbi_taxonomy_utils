Description: # IDbyDNA utilities
        
        ## Description
        A collection of modules created by IDbyDNA
        
        ## Resources for building packages
        Example package build at https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/
        
        Command to build: python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        Command to install: `pip install git+<git repository url>[@branch][#subdirectory=path/to/package/directory]`
        
        To install this package:
        
        pip install git+https://github.com/idbydna/taxonomer.git@snakemake_dev#subdirectory=utils/idbd_utils
        
        ### Additional hints
        To include data files in package:
        
        `include_package_data=True` in setup function in setup.py
        
        Add MANIFEST.in with `include relative/path/to/data/resource`. It is best to include the
        data resources in the same directory as the module. In the module, reference the data
        resources with the ``__file__`` property which points to where the module python script
        is stored on the local machine.

        ## Updating
        To update, run ncbi_taxonomy_utils_constructor.py to generate new pickle resource files.
        Include these in the same directory as the module.
